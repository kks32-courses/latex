Appropriate use of colour makes graphs clearer and more informative for the viewer. However, a significant proportion of the population experience some degree of colour-blindness - an inability to perceive or distinguish between certain colours. The most common kind is red-green colour blindness, affecting up to 10% of men, and a smaller proportion of women. 

Vischeck has examples here of how different colour combinations are perceived in different categories of colour-blindness: [http://www.vischeck.com/examples/](http://www.vischeck.com/examples/) 

When creating graphs, it is therefore useful to think about whether your graph is still clear and informative to a viewer who cannot perceive or distinguish between the full range of colours. The simplest way to make sure that all of your viewers can interpret your graphs is to convey information either without relying on colour (for example, distinguishing between bars on a graph, or sections of a pie chart, using different patterns, rather than different colours), or by using pattern in conjunction with colour.

You can also choose colour combinations ‘intelligently’: avoiding using red and green on the same graph, for example. Red-blue and yellow-blue colour combinations are distinguishable for viewers with the commonest kind of colour-blindness. 

Making your graphs suitable for colour-blind users has further advantages. If figures are to be used in future publications, they should ideally be as informative in black and white as in colour; some journals require figures to be in black and white. By considering colour-blind viewers when creating graphs, you will improve the appearance of your graphs when viewed in black and white, saving time (and possibly money in colour figure journal fees!) later on.

The BBC recommend several tools to help you, for example this colour contrast checker: [http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html](http://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html)

Penn State University has examples of good and bad practice here: [http://accessibility.psu.edu/charts](http://accessibility.psu.edu/charts)

And if you need a web-based tool to change the colours of your graphs to make them more accessible, you could try Daltonize: [http://www.vischeck.com/daltonize/](http://www.vischeck.com/daltonize/)
